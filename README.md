## Cause
The reason for creating this repository was my inability to pass on interview, namely: problems with terminology, the formulation of thoughts on oral from and oral communication.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my skills, repeat and close knowledge gaps. And course, a job search for the position of "Qa engineer"

## I am fine
My name is Evgeniy Parshin. I have no higher education, certificates or completed courses in the IT field. All that i can and know, i read on the Internet and tried it in practice.

P.S. "BaroH4er" translates as a "Railway carriage".
